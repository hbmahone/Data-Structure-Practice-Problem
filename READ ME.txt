This is a java project as part of practice problems. The package contained all the files needed.

Summary:
	The positions were stored in a tree data structure due to there being a hierarchy. Each position contains a getDirectReports Set. This set contained all the positions(children) 
	of current position. In order to implement the Hire function, I needed to search through the tree. I created a preorder depth first search algorithm to do this. 
	Once the position was found and not full, then I created a New Employee and assigned it to that position.  

  	Changes:
	Only Organization.java received new code
	Created a SearchForPositin() to check if the position exists and is open
	Created and ID for each employee
	Created a new Employee in the Hire() 
	Set the the new Employee to the open position
